# Eli Murray

I am a journalist who codes for the Tampa Bay Times. I use software to inform reporting and present compelling narratives. I take a lot of pride in my self-motivation and ability to learn new tools on deadline.

Prior to joining the Tampa Bay Times, I studied at Sauk Valley Community College where I was active in theatre and took creative writing courses. After I earned my associate degree, I went on to study journalism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. During my first year at UofI I worked as a beat reporter at The Daily Illini.

It was the summer between junior and senior year when I first learned to code. I discovered the satisfaction of solving logic puzzles and I recognized the potential to use these skills to do journalism. That year I spent my days in class studying journalism and my nights and weekends hacking together servers, making graphics in javascript, and going to hackathons.

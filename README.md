I am a journalist who codes for the Tampa Bay Times. I use software to inform reporting and present compelling narratives. I take great pride in my self-motivation and ability to learn new tools on deadline.

Before joining the Tampa Bay Times, I studied at Sauk Valley Community College, where I was active in theatre and took creative writing courses. After earning my associate degree, I studied journalism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. During my first year at UofI, I worked as a beat reporter at The Daily Illini.

I first learned to code during the summer between my junior and senior years. I discovered the satisfaction of solving logic puzzles and recognized the potential to use these skills to do journalism. That year I spent my days in class studying journalism and my nights and weekends hacking servers together, making javascript graphics, and going to hackathons.
